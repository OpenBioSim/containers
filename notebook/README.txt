Welcome to try.openbiosim.org!
==============================

You can use this notebook server to try out OpenBioSim's software.

To get started, have a look at the "quick start" guides for 
BioSimSpace and sire.

* https://biosimspace.openbiosim.org/quickstart
* https://sire.openbiosim.org/quickstart

Open a Jupyter notebook or ipython console session and follow
the examples in those guides.

Or, for a more detailed explanation, follow the tutorials.

This free JupyterHub server is limited. You only have up to 2 GB of memory
and at most 1 processor core. Disk storage is temporary, and any data will 
be lost when you log out. Because it only supports a limited number of 
concurrent users, inactive sessions will be automatically stopped and 
logged out after 20 minutes. 

Please only use this service to explore and learn OpenBioSim's software.

Do not use it for production work.
